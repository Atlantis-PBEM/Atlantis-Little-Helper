The linux binary was built on Mandriva 2006, it is a bit outdated environment.

It is not statically linked, so it requires wxWindows libraries
installed. Do not worry, you do not have to build wxw yourself,
it is available from www.wxwindows.org -
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxwindows/wxGTK-2.4.2-1.i386.rpm

Please notice that many distributions come with test version of wxw (2.5.x), 
while ALH uses the latest stable version (2.4.2). 
In order to run ALH, wxw 2.4.2 must be installed even though 2.5.x is already 
installed. Both versions can coexist on the same system without any conflicts.


For Python-enabled build you will need, well, Python. If your version is 
too old, get a newer one from http://www.python.org.
